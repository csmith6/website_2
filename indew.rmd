## Filtering Rows and Columns 

With SQL, you can filter columns with SELECT 
and rows with WHERE.Let's look at an example 
using the Lahman baseball database. First, we need
to load some packages
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Suppoose we want to see the HR
totals for the 1927 Yankees. 
We could write the following:
```{r}
query <- "SELECT playerID, yearID, teamID, HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```

## Further SQL Knowledge
Today we learned more extensive SQL commands
along with ordering our querys by certain catagories.

Here is an example a selective SQL query using homeruns (HR) and the teamID of the New York Yankees:
```{r}
query <- "SELECT playerID, teamID, yearID, HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR>=40"
sqldf(query)
```

Also, we learned hot set greater than and less than parameters within a query:
```{r}
query2 <- query <- "SELECT playerID, teamID, yearID, HR, SO FROM Batting
WHERE SO<60 and HR>40"
sqldf(query2)
```

Here is another example demonstrating greater than or equal to and less than or equal to filters within a query: 
```{r}
query3 <- "SELECT playerID, teamID, yearID, HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='PHI' and HR>30 and yearID>=1970 and yearID<=1979"
sqldf(query3)
```

Along with those previous functions, we also learned how to order our results using the ORDER BY query function. Notice that there is a DESC portion of that code that orders our results in a descending fashion:
```{r}
query4 <- "SELECT playerID, yearID, teamID, HR FROM Batting 
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query4)
```

We can also use the ASC command after the ORDER BY funtion within the query to order our results in a ascending fashion:
```{r}
query5 <- "SELECT playerId, teamID, yearID, SO FROM Batting
WHERE SO<10 and AB>=400
ORDER BY SO ASC"
sqldf(query5)
```
##Aggregation

Aggregation allows you to group the data. Using GROUP BY will perform the command. There a multiple ways to Group the data:

*sum(colname) gives you the sum

*avg(colname) gives you the average

*max(colname) gives you the maximum

*min(colname) gives you the minimum

#### Examples
##### #1
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, sum(HR) 
FROM Batting 
WHERE playerID='ruthba01' 
GROUP BY playerID" 

sqldf(query) 
```
##### #2
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, sum(HR)
FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID 
HAVING sum(HR)>=600 
ORDER BY sum(HR) DESC" 

sqldf(query) 
```
##### #3
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, avg(HR)
FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID 
HAVING avg(HR)>30 
ORDER BY avg(HR) DESC" 

sqldf(query)
```
## Joining
Joining allows data from multiple tables to be used together by using the commands INNER JOIN and ON. 

#### Examples
##### #1
```{r}
query<-"SELECT nameFIRST, nameLAST, teamID, yearID, HR  
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master 
ON Batting.playerID=Master.playerID 
WHERE Batting.playerID='ruthba01'" 

sqldf(query) 
```
##### #2
```{r}
query<-"SELECT nameFirst,nameLast,teamID,yearID,HR 
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Master 
ON Batting.playerID=Master.playerID 
WHERE Batting.HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC" 

sqldf(query) 
```
##### #3
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,name,Batting.yearID,Batting.HR 
FROM Batting INNER JOIN Teams 
ON Batting.teamID=Teams.teamID and Batting.yearID=Teams.yearID 
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'" 

sqldf(query) 
```
